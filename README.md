The Crystal Collector Game

This is a game built using jquery and javascript where the user has to click on crystal skulls in order to hit a target number.
The target number and the values of each crystal are randomly generated each round and the user isn't able to see the values of the crystals until they click on them. 

To get started, click a crystal! The game will reset each round and keeps a scoreboard of your wins and losses.
