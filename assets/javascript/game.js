// Global Variables wins, loses, target score, your score
var randomNum = generateRandom();

//array of crystal opject (to loop through)

//dynamically create crystals on the page (one object per crystal)
   //each crystal needs a score, an image, [aka a string holding the path to the image - which is saved in a folder in your project] an object with all of this info (aka collection of key value parts)

// Random number Function:
function generateRandom()
   //something with math...
   //return a random number

//Click event function
   //each crystal should have the same class so that you dont need 4 seperate click events
   //var score = yourScore + crystalValue;


//start/reset game
   //clear out variables (especially your score)
   //set target score
   //assign a value for each crystals
   // .empty will be helpful
   //If your score is grater than target score, then...
   //If yourScore is less than, then... `
